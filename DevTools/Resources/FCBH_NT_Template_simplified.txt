JHN	8	44	Jesus	#07		4443	" {44} You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies."

HEB	4	6	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9177	 {6} Those who received the good news first did not obey. So they do not enter God's rest. Others may therefore still enter.
HEB	4	7	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9178	" {7} God again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),"

HEB	7	3	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9243	" He has neither beginning of days nor end of life. Like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever."
HEB	7	4	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9244	" {4} Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils."
HEB	7	5	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9245	 {5} They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law.

HEB	9	21	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9328	 {21} Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood.
HEB	9	22	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9329	" {22} According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission."
HEB	9	23	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9330	 {23} It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these;
HEB	9	23	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9331	 but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
HEB	9	24	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9332	" {24} For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true,"

HEB	9	25	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9334	" {25} Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own."
HEB	9	26	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9335	 {26} Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world.
HEB	9	26	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9336	" But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
HEB	9	27	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9337	" {27} It is appointed for all men to die once, and after this, judgment."
HEB	9	28	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9338	 {28} It is the same with Christ also. He was offered once to bear the sins of many.

HEB	10	1	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9342	" can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near."
HEB	10	2	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9343	" {2} Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?"
HEB	10	3	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9344	 {3} But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.
HEB	10	4	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9345	 {4} For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
HEB	10	5	Narr_019: Hebrews	#10		9346	" {5} Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,"
