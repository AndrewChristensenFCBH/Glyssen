# Getting Started
Glyssen assists with the process of preparing an audio recording script for
dramatizing Scripture. It is intended for producing publishable-quality recordings.
To start a new project in  Glyssen, you will need a Digital Bible Library "text
release bundle" with at least one book of Scripture that has been approved for
publishing. Glyssen does not read Standard Format files or data directly from
Paratext projects. Once you have created a project and made a few basic decisions
about project settings and what books to record, there are four main phases to the
recording project:
1.	Identify speaking parts and align vernacular script blocks with the reference
	text. Ideally, this task should be done by someone who knows both the vernacular
	language and the reference text language(s). If the vernacular text uses
	consistent quotation mark punctuation, Glyssen can usually do most of this work
	for you. In a relatively small number of places, it will require you to confirm
	its guesses or make manual decisions. This process can take anywhere from a few
	hours to a few days.
2.	Make cast selections. This involves deciding how many voice actors you will use,
	identifying those people, and having Glyssen help divide up the work among them.
3.	Field recording. Glyssen is not a recording tool. You can use recording software,
	such as Audacity or Adobe Audition to record all the clips for each voice actor.
	Be sure to set up an environment that minimizes ambient noise and use high-
	quality recording equipment to get the best possible results.
4.	Post-production. This is key to getting a great-sounding final product. Glyssen
	doesn't really help with this part of the process, other than to include
	annotations in the scripts it produces that will help the post-production team.

# What to Back Up
Glyssen stores all its project files in the Program Data folder, under the
SIL-FCBH\Glyssen directory. On a default installation of Windows 7, that would be
here: <a href="file:///C:/ProgramData/FCBH-SIL/Glyssen">
C:\ProgramData\FCBH-SIL\Glyssen</a>. To support multiple
recording projects, versions, and languages, there will be three levels of subfolders
under that folder. Back up the whole thing. If you are using Glyssen to generate empty
clip files for the recording phase, the software lets you choose where to create those.
Back those up also. If your project is based on a text release bundle that is in the
Digital Bible Library and you have access to that, you don't need to back it up, but
for the sake of convenience, you want to.

# Release Notes

## March 2017
Added context menus useful when identifying speaking parts and aligning vernacular
blocks to the reference text. (This also gives a way to add project-specific characters
or deliveries without having to leave "rainbow mode".)
